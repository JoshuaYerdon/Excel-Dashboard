## Dashboard Decription
I found a simple dataset about ranking ramen types on Kaggle. It included things like the rating, type of ramen, brand, country, and the form or packaging of the ramen. 
Here's a quick 60-second summary:

## Quick Rundown

I started by using functions like **UNIQUE** and **SORT** to organize the data into groups.

```
=ROUND(AVERAGEIF(Data!B3:B2582,$A3,Data!F3:F2582), 2)
=SORT(A2:C354,2,-1)
```

Then, I used **COUNTIF** to count key numbers or items that helped give insights.

I added the following IF statements:

<br>
```
=IF(I3<>company,J3,N/A())
=IF($I2=company,$J2,N/A())
```
This changed the color of rows that didnâ€™t match the selected data for a better visual look.

I used **XLOOKUP** to find the rating for that choice and display it on the graph. <br>

```
=XLOOKUP(company,I2:I16,K2:K16)
```

Lastly, I repeated this process two more times for the remaining graphs.
